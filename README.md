# Effect of COVID-19 on the Academic Performance of GITAM Students

The outbreak of COVID-19 affected almost every sector, including higher education institutions worldwide, particularly the Indian Educational System. For this purpose, we aimed to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on the academic performance of GITAM students of the 2018 batch from Hyderabad Campus. Using Python, we present the analysis of academic performance, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the students' grades scraped from the results page of the University.

The technique is divided into three fragments: the web scraper draws the desired links from the web, then the required data is extracted to a CSV file, and finally, the analysis is presented with the extracted data. The Python language is implemented for the carrying out.
